# FinanceAI Dashboard - Setup Instructions

## Critical Fixes Applied

This document contains the setup instructions for the newly integrated and fixed FinanceAI Dashboard. The following critical issues have been resolved:

### 🚨 **MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED:**

1. **✅ PDF.js Worker Configuration**: Fixed PDF import functionality 
2. **✅ Data Integration**: Connected new features (Goals, Forecasting) to real user data
3. **✅ Database Schema**: Added Goals table and proper triggers
4. **✅ Service Integration**: Connected all AI services to the app context
5. **✅ Budget Tracking**: Added automatic spent amount calculation
6. **✅ Type Safety**: Updated all type definitions for consistency

---

## 🗃️ **Database Setup (CRITICAL)**

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

You **MUST** run these SQL migrations in your Supabase SQL editor for the app to work properly:

```sql
-- 1. First, run the goals table migration:
-- Copy and paste the contents of: migrations/001_create_goals_table.sql

-- 2. Then, run the budget triggers migration:
-- Copy and paste the contents of: migrations/002_budget_triggers.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables

After running the migrations, verify these tables exist in your Supabase dashboard:
- ✅ `profiles`
- ✅ `transactions` 
- ✅ `budgets`
- ✅ `goals` (newly added)

---

## 🔧 **Environment Setup**

### Required Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file should contain:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Google Gemini AI API Configuration
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Next.js Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=FinanceAI
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## 🚀 **Development Setup**

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Application
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port shown in terminal)
- The app will automatically use the next available port if 3000 is taken

## 🔍 **Testing the Fixes**

### Test Import Functionality
1. Go to **Import Data** page
2. Try uploading a PDF bank statement
3. ✅ Should work without PDF.js worker errors

### Test Goals Integration  
1. Go to **Goals** page
2. Add a new financial goal
3. ✅ Should save to database and appear in list
4. ✅ AI analysis should use your real transaction data

### Test Budget Tracking
1. Go to **Budgets** page  
2. Create a budget for a category (e.g., "Food & Dining")
3. Add transactions in that category
4. ✅ Budget spent amount should update automatically

### Test Forecasting
1. Go to **Forecasting** page
2. ✅ Should show predictions based on your actual transaction history
3. ✅ No more mock data

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### If you see "No data" messages:
1. **Add some transactions first** - Go to Transactions page and add a few sample transactions
2. **Check authentication** - Make sure you're logged in
3. **Verify database tables** - Ensure all migrations were run successfully

### If PDF import fails:
1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify file size** - Keep PDFs under 10MB
3. **Try with a simple text file first** to test AI parsing

### If goals/forecasting show errors:
1. **Ensure database migrations were run** - Goals table must exist
2. **Add transaction history** - AI features need data to analyze
3. **Check API keys** - Verify Google Gemini API key is valid

### If budgets don't update:
1. **Run budget trigger migration** - Ensures automatic spent amount calculation
2. **Manual refresh** - The system includes manual refresh functions
3. **Check transaction categories** - Must match budget categories exactly
